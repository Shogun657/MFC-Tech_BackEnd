# MFC-Tech_BackEnd
# Out of the various tasks given by the club in the technical domain, I have chosen to perform the Backend task of web development.
# This task states that I have to create a web API (Application Programming Interface) and implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a library management system.
# On a personal level, I currently don't posess the adequate knowledge for implementing an API, but I have been extremely intrigued by web development and application development, particularly Backend development and this is one domain that I would love to contribute in for this club. I have started taking up basic database management system courses in programming languages like C++ and Python.
# The language that I'll be implementing the system is in C as I have familiarised myself with this particular language via my Computer Science and Engineering course "Object-Oriented and Structured Programming" and currently, I feel comfortable in programming in C.
# With time, I'll be looking forward to working in object-oriented languages like C++, Python and Java.
# Kindly excuse any inconveniences that I create with my program.
